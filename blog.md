# First-Day @ Epicodus
## We are _Garrett_ & _Jonelle_
### We worked with:
* Git
* GitHub
* Markdown
> Create a new project folder on your desktop and write a blog post about your day/your favorite food/favorite vacation  destination, etc. Save the file with .md as the extension on it and make sure to track the file with git. Go to Daring Fireball and choose a couple formatting elements that we didn't teach you in the lesson and use them in your blog post. You can preview you Markdown file in Visual Studio Code using command-shift-v. Remember to make commits and push your files up to GitHub!
